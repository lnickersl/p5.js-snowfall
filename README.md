# p5.js-snowfall
Snowfall animation with perlin noise wind effect

This project was made using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) framework

### [Live demo](https://lnickersl.github.io/p5.js-snowfall/)


## Usage
Max snowflake size with scale = 1
> var size = 30;

Sharpness of random side movements
> var perlinNoise = 0.005;

Strength of side movement
> var windMultiplier = 5;

The lower the value, the greater the bonds between snowflakes in sideway movement.
> var bondStr = 3;
